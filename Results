These results do make logical sense in a broader sense. As the rate of cars increases, so does the amount of traffic, thus leading to longer lines; this is the behaviour the model displays. In the rigor of a Deterministic distribution, the model shows that nearly no cars are ever made to wait in a queue. Moreover, the longest delays occur in the Correlated distribution, which is specifically rigged so that, for 20% of the time, the amount of time a customer is serviced does not decrease. This should lead to a general upward trend. However, I admit I am more than a little confused as to why these delays are so long. Surely a smaller increase in cars should not lead to a 2+ day delay. Therefore, I must conclude that there has been some failure in the way the model was coded or implemented that permitted such drastic results.
